<p>
   Camp Half-Blood is a camp for all Greek demigod children. It's protected by a magical border to keep all demigods safe.
   The thing is that demigods are hunted by all types of mythical greek creatures. This is because they hate the Gods and 
   want to take revenge by hurting their offspring. The good thing is that at Camp Half-Blood, demigods are trained to fight 
   monsters and keep themselves alive. In fact, demigods are even born with ADHD because of their fighting reflexes.
