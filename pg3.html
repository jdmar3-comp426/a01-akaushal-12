<p>If you're still thinking that Camp Half-Blood is a regular camp, you're 100% completely wrong. They don't tie dye shirts here.
They do roast marshmellows, though, but anyways. Along with their training and housing of demigods, Camp-HaLf Blood has an array 
of amenities for all demigod children to use. They have magical plates and cups that are never ending, and you can wish for whatever 
food you like. They also have an insane sauna, fighting arena, and did I mention they're right on the beach?
P.S. Percy usually likes to have blue coke as well as blue chocolate chip cookies for dessert because that's what his mom used to make
him on special occasions. Plus he's the son of Posidon, the God of the Ocean, so yeah blue's his favorite color.</p>
