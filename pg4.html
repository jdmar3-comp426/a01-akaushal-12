<p>If you haven't read all the amenities that Camp HaLf-Blood has, then please go back and read it (seriously, you're missing out).
The thing is Camp Half-Blood does have an insane amount of amenities, but many demigods get called on missions, called quests, where 
they have to consult the Oracle of Delphi (which gives them a propecy), and go on a mission to retrieve an artifact, return something stolen,
or whatever the Oracle tells them. Basically, right a wrong or prevent evil and chaos from ensuing. 
Luckily, all Demigods are allowed to have two friends accompany them. Percy's two friends are always Annabeth and Grover.
Grover is satyr. Super funny and he's Percy's best friend. He also is our all-knowing guide about the demigod-world because Percy's relatively
new to it.
Annabeth is also one of Percy's best friends. She is the daughter of Athena (the Goddess of Wisdom), and therefore always the brains of the group.
Together, they always end up fighting monsters, finishing their mission, and coming back to Camp Half-Blood successful.</p>
