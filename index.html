<p>Percy Jackson is a mythical character made by Rick Riordan. He is the son of Posidon, half-God and half-human (a demigod if you will). He is part of the big prophecy that will save or destroy the world, and in every book, he is chosen for a new quest which all tie into defeating the enemy of the Gods: Kronos.Explore the website to learn more about the world of Percy Jackson!</p>
